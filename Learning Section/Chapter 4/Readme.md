# Learning Functions in C# README

## Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 4 ! This README provides an overview of the Chapters goals, contents, and how to get the most out of it.

### Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to help you solidify your understanding of functions in the C# programming language. By the end of this learning experience, you should:

- Have a clear understanding of what functions are and how they work in C#.
- Be able to create and use functions to modularize your code.
- Understand the importance of function parameters and return values.
- Know how to work with different types of functions, including void, value-returning, and recursive functions.
- Be familiar with best practices and common patterns related to functions in C#.

### Contents

This project consists of the following components:

1. **Code Examples:** A collection of C# code examples that illustrate various aspects of working with functions.

2. **Exercises:** A set of hands-on exercises designed to reinforce your knowledge and skills related to C# functions.

3. **Additional Resources:** A list of recommended books, articles, and online tutorials for further exploration.
